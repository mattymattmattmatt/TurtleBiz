      <h1>BREAKING NEWS: Potential Medical Breakthrough in Mansfield Park</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Two rats in Mansfield Park, Adelaide, appear to have developed an extraordinary immune system 
        after ingesting a mysterious pea-like substance. This discovery is causing a stir in the 
        global medical community.
      </p>

      <div class="discovery-info">
        <h2>The Discovery</h2>
        <p>
          According to local residents, the two rats—fondly nicknamed “Manny” and “Parker”—were found 
          in a small neighborhood park. Vets who examined them noticed something incredible: these 
          rodents were seemingly impervious to common infections that would typically debilitate rats. 
          Their blood work showed extremely high levels of immune cells, far beyond anything previously 
          observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The substance they consumed, believed to be a hybrid pea-like pod, was discovered partially 
          buried under mulch near a community garden. Scientists are unsure whether it is a natural 
          mutation of a common legume, the byproduct of a chemical spill, or something altogether new.
        </p>

      <div class="search-info">
        <h2>The Search for Answers</h2>
        <p>
          Teams of scientists, local volunteers, and community organizers are now searching the area, 
          hoping to recover more samples of this potential “super-pea.” Multiple organizations, including 
          the Adelaide Health Institute, have already sent specialists to Mansfield Park to coordinate 
          efforts with local authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the substance is still undergoing preliminary tests, researchers have expressed cautious 
          optimism that its properties may be applicable to humans. If proven safe, the discovery could 
          revolutionize treatments for infections, chronic illnesses, and even possibly cancer.

      <div class="expert-opinions">
        <h2>Expert Opinions</h2>
        
        <h3>Dr. Alistair Clifton, Lead Researcher at Adelaide Health Institute</h3>
        <p>
          “We have never encountered anything that shows such robust immunological activity in rodents,” 
          says Dr. Clifton. “Our preliminary analysis suggests the substance triggers an unusually 
          high production of T-cells, which help the body fight off disease. Further studies could 
          reveal new pathways to combat serious illnesses in humans.”
        </p>
        
        <h3>Dr. Monica Chavez, Immunologist at South Australian Medical Center</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Chavez, who is collaborating with local labs, adds, “What’s truly remarkable is that 
          these rats show an immune response that practically neutralizes infections almost as soon as 
          they arise. If the compound responsible for this can be identified and synthesized, it could 
          open the door to breakthroughs we’ve only dreamed of in the field of immunotherapy.”
        </p>
        
        <h3>Dr. Samir Gupta, Research Scientist at University of Adelaide</h3>
        <p>
          “We need to be vigilant,” warns Dr. Gupta. “We’re dealing with an unknown substance. 
          We don’t yet know if it has any adverse side effects—either for the rats or potentially for 
          humans. Our next step is to identify the biochemical structure and then test it extensively 
          in controlled lab environments.”
